### About
> This site is built using React, Javascript/TypeScript, and Node-sass.
I have a terrible eye for design, so I borrowed the theme from an HTML5Up template. I did build the site completely from scratch on my own, as the original was not built using React.
> I just started to learn TypeScript and I am slowly converting as I learn.

### Links
- [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/)
- [React-Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll)
- [HTML5UP Templates](https://html5up.net/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
---
### Features
- Smooth scroll was implemented using the React-Scroll NPM package. 
- The information icon is from Font Awesome and is used to display a description for each project. 
- The video 'play' icon is also from Font Awesome, and is used to display a demo video (if there is one)
- All GitHub repos are linked for each project
---
### Projects
> Projects are read in dynamically from 'projects.js'. The video 'play' button and the 'Live Site' link are conditionally rendered if there is an associated video or a live site. All images are compressed to be under 1MB using tinyPng website.
---
### Skills
> Skills are dynamically parsed in from skillsData.js file. They maintain their positioning through the use of css rule: 'display: table'.
I decided to rank my skills by 2 categories: 'Top Skills' and 'Other Skills'. Top skills are those that I am fairly comfortable using and have had plenty of hands on experience with. The 'Other Skills' are those that I have learned and used maybe once, so I am not as fluent but do have some exposure to.

### Contact
> I decided to exclude the contact form as it allows bot emails to come through without a captcha and I didn't want to build a back-end just so I could use a captcha.
---
### Testing
> Unit testing with React-Testing-Library/Jest. Still adding test coverage in the future, this site is nowhere near fully tested.
